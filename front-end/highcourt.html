        <h1>High Court</h1>
        <div id="supreme">
            <p>A high court typically refers to the highest court in a particular jurisdiction, such as a state or country. High courts have varying names and functions depending on the legal system of the country in which they exist. Here are some key points about high courts:</p>

                    <div class="about-supreme">
                        <h4>Jurisdiction:</h4>
                        <p>High courts generally have jurisdiction over a specific geographic area or territory. In some countries, they handle cases at the state or provincial level, while in others, they have jurisdiction over the entire country.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
              <li> 
                 <div class="about-supreme">
                    <h4>Appellate Jurisdiction:</h4>
                    <p>High courts often serve as appellate courts, which means they hear appeals from lower courts, such as district courts or trial courts. They review cases to ensure that lower court decisions were made correctly and in accordance with the law.

                   <h4>Legal Systems:</h4>
                   <p> The structure and functions of high courts can vary
                     significantly from one country to another, depending on the country's legal system. Common law countries, like the United States and the United Kingdom, have high courts that handle both civil and criminal appeals. In civil law countries, high courts may primarily focus on civil and administrative matters</p>

            <li>
                <div class="about-supreme">
                    <h4>Judges:</h4>
                    <p> High courts are typically staffed with judges who are appointed based on their legal expertise and experience. In many cases, judges at this level are appointed for life or until a certain retirement age to ensure their independence.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>

                            <div class="about-supreme">
                        <h4>Role in Interpretation of Laws:</h4>
                        <p> High courts often play a crucial role in interpreting and clarifying the laws of their respective jurisdictions. Their decisions can set legal precedents that lower courts must follow.</p>
                    </div>
                    </li>

                    <h4>Constitutional Matters: </h4>
                    <p> In many countries, high courts have a special role in interpreting and upholding the constitution. They may have the authority to determine the constitutionality of laws and government actions.</p>
                </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="about-supreme">
                <h4>Names:</h4>
                <p>The name of the high court can vary by country. For example, in the United States, the highest court is the Supreme Court, while in India, each state has its own high court, and there is a separate Supreme Court of India at the national level. In some countries, high courts may be referred to as "superior courts" or "appellate courts."

                <h4>Original Jurisdiction:</h4>
                <p> In addition to their appellate role, high courts may also have original jurisdiction, which means they can hear certain types of cases directly without the need for them to be appealed from lower courts. These cases often involve constitutional matters or disputes between states or regions.
