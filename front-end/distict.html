        <h1>District Court</h1>
        <div id="supreme">
            <p>
                A District Court is a type of trial court that exists in many legal systems, particularly in the United States. Here's an explanation of what a District Court is and its functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div class="about-supreme">
                        <h4>Trial Court:</h4>
                        <p>A District Court is a court of general jurisdiction, meaning it has the authority to hear a wide range of cases, including both civil and criminal cases. It is often the first court where legal disputes are resolved.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
              <li> 
                 <div class="about-supreme">
                    <h4>Geographic Jurisdiction:</h4>
                    <p>The term "District" in District Court typically refers to a specific geographic area, such as a county, city, or region. Each geographic area has its own District Court, and these courts handle cases that occur within their jurisdiction
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="about-supreme">
                   <h4>Civil Cases: </h4>
                   <p> In civil cases, District Courts handle disputes between individuals or entities (e.g., individuals, corporations, or government agencies) where one party is seeking damages, an injunction, or some other legal remedy. Civil cases can include contract disputes, personal injury cases, family law matters (divorce, child custody), and more.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
           
            <li>
                <div class="about-supreme">
                    <h4>Criminal Cases:</h4>
                    <p> In criminal cases, District Courts handle cases in which individuals are charged with violating criminal laws. They conduct preliminary hearings, arraignments, and trials for criminal offenses, ranging from minor infractions to serious felonies.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                      
                <li>
                <div class="about-supreme">
                        <h4>Federal vs. State:</h4>
                        <p>In the United States, there are both federal and state-level District Courts. Federal District Courts handle cases involving federal laws, constitutional issues, or cases between parties from different states (diversity jurisdiction). State District Courts, on the other hand, handle cases involving state laws and regulations.</p>
                    </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="about-supreme">
                    <h4>Judges: </h4>
                    <p> District Courts are presided over by judges who are responsible for making legal rulings, overseeing trials, and ensuring that cases are conducted fairly and according to the law</p>
                </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="about-supreme">
                <h4>Jury Trials: </h4>
                <p>Many cases in District Courts involve jury trials. In a jury trial, a group of citizens (the jury) listens to the evidence presented by both sides and makes a decision regarding the outcome of the case.
                </p>
            </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="about-supreme">
            <h4>Appeals:</h4>
            <p>Decisions made by District Courts can often be appealed to a higher court, such as an appellate court or a state supreme court, depending on the jurisdiction. The appeals process allows parties to challenge the legal rulings or decisions made in District Court.</p>
        </div>
        </li>
            </ul>

     <p>Overall, District Courts play a critical role in the legal system by resolving a wide range of legal disputes, both civil and criminal, at the trial level. They are essential in upholding justice and ensuring that cases are adjudicated fairly and in accordance with the law</p>
